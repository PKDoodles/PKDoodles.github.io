          <h1> Project Overview</h1>
          <p> This is my first ever Unreal Engine 5 Project for my first unviersity moduler using the Sentinel framework! The framework consist of an asset pack
            with the basic movements of a characrter set up. In which we had to make an engaging level with both level and systems design basics.
             In which I made a light horror-platformer game called Chain Locked.  <br>
            <br>
            This project gave me a solid understanding of the basics of Unreal Engine 5 and how to create an engaging level that improved by constant interation and testing.
            I learned the improtance of environemental storytelling and guidance as well as the power of different camera angles to create thematic situations. <br>
            <br>
            As I become more experienced with game design, I feel I can criticise parts of this project I overlooked before such as the importance of forgiveness mechanics and more clear affordance through lighting.
            That being said, I am still extremely happy with this project and I think it demonstrates my enthusiasm towards learning the complexities of game design and Unreal Engine!
